# Unity-VideoGameLoadout
Game of progression involving unlocking game features such as user interface elements and controller input.  Features are used as learning outcomes for students

Idea: 
User unlocks various gameplay mechanics through interfacing with the application. The process of progression will be presented to the user in a manner that enforces a clear understanding of the gameplay features being unlocked.
Example: 
Game starts.
-User prompt. 
"Hello, do you like video games? y/n"
-User provides input.
All inputs at this point result in the following dialogue.
-User prompt.
"I do not understand, please select one of the following features."
The ability to accept user input.
The ability to display a minimap.
The ablity to click with mouse.
The player.... " etc.....

From userprompt to a wumpus world with keyboard, to a side scrolling shooter, to a 3d fighting game. 
End result determined by the amount of game features completed and integrated within the game.
Ideas left open. All additions to codebase would be items submitted via prefab. No coupling of components to "god objects, like game manager right now"
This is meant to be fun
